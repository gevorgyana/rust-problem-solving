As it is common with such tasks, when you are given a linear amount of
memory and asked to perform something that will take N! * N or 2 ^ N * N
time with a straighforward approach, start thinking as hard as you can
about what magic you can do to the linear data to make sure than at some
point in time, you can just gather the answer from one or some of the
cells in table. I have no other explanation of dynamic programming. It
works like magic.
